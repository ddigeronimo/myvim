# My .vimrc

I've switched to [Neovim](https://neovim.io), which I highly recommend you check out as well. Rather than continue modifying this .vimrc I've started a seperate config to take advantage of Neovim's many upgrades. That being said, having a working Vim setup is still useful, so I'm keeping this accessible on GitHub and may occasionally push updates if I have reason to.

## Install:
    git clone https://github.com/ddigeronimo/myvim ~/.vim

## Create Symlink:
    ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc

## Setup for Ideavim:
    ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.ideavimrc
